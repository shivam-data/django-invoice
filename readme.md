# Project Title

Invoice manager on Django

## Getting Started

Note: Instead of deploying the app to cloud, the dockerized version of this django-app is created so that it can be easily scaled.

The web-app and database is containerized or micro-serviced for scalability.

You can find dockerized version in 'finalone-dockerized'.

### Prerequisites for dockerized

What things you need to install 

```
# install docker
# install docker-compose
# pull the dockerized version
```

```
# And finally run

docker-compose up
```

### Prerequisites for normal

If you want to check non-dockerized version, simply run django-app in conventional method.

First

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
then

```
python manage.py runserver

```
